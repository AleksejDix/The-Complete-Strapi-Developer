The course also comes with 3 cheat sheet PDFs with tons of tips, tricks and reminders.

In order to receive the PDFs message me inside of the course (either Podia or Udemy).

## The other Code Repos
Each project has a separate code repo.
Read the Readme of each repo for hints on how to clone the code and set up your own project.

Please note that the code is kind of useless unless you know what it's doing.
You are better off watching the videos, coding along and then using the code as a reminder.
